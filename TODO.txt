* Easier way to create trees with these same leaf set in different options (i.e., data context approach)

* Add option to specify posterior probability support as Nexus node comment in SumTrees

* Add "``clone``" and "``merge``" methods for Dataset and all contained data structures; for trees, taxa are shallow copies, but all other objects are deep copies

* Move taxon label validation to parse_newick_node_stream and allow the encoding of splits during the reading of a newick string::

    if encoding_splits:
        if node.is_leaf():
            node.taxon = blah
            index = taxa_block.get_index(node.taxon)
            node.edge.split_mask = 1 << index
        else:
            node.edge.split_mask = 0L
            for child in node.child_nodes:
                node.edge.split_mask |= child.edge.split_mask
    return node     

* check element annotation (attribute names and ``annotate_as``)

* make sure count_splits in split_distribution does not always pick splits rather than clades

* trees have taxa_block; added during parsing
