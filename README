To install the pynexml library, end-users can run:
$ python setup.py install

Developers, who are using the "cutting-edge" code via svn may prefer to use the develop command. This installs an egg-link to the path of the nexml/python directory in the appropriate site-packages directory in your python installation. Thus, you will not have to reinstall after every change to the code:
$ python setup.py develop
