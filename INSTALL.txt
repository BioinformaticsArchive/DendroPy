DendroPy installs and works out-of-the-box under Python 2.5.x. It will work under Python 2.4.x if the `ElementTrees module <http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree>`_ is separately installed. The library itself functions perfectly fine under Python 2.6.x, but setuptools has not yet released an easyinstall egg for this version, so the automated installation of the library is not currently functioning (see below). DendroPy will not work under 2.3 without a lot of effort, and is broken under 3.0.

To install the DendroPy library, end-users can run::

    $ python setup.py install

As mentioned above, this currently only works under Python 2.5. You can also manually install the library by one of the following:

    * Add the current location of the ``dendropy`` subdirectory to your Python path environmental variable, ``$PYTHONPATH``
    
    * Copy (or symlink) the ``dendropy`` directory to the ``site-packages`` directory of your Python installation
    
You might also want to place the scripts in the ``scripts/`` subdirectory on your system path.

Note: If you install the Nexus Class Library version 2.2 compiled with the --with-swig-python option passed to configure, then dendropy can use NCL to parse files. This improves the speed of the parse and will handle some exotic NEXUS syntaxes that are not supported by dendropy's pure-python parser.
