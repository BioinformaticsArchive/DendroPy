Release 3.4.0
-------------

Changes
^^^^^^^
    - ``age`` is now a permanent attribute of ``Node`` objects from initialization (previously, this attribute was optionally added when ``add_ages_to_nodes()`` was called).
    - ``Tree.add_ages_to_nodes()`` replaced by ``Tree.calc_node_ages()``: functioning is similar, but no longer offers the option for client code to select attribute name for the node age; this is now fixed to ``age`` (see above).

Release 3.3.0
-------------

Changes
^^^^^^^

    * An exception is now thrown when branches with edge weights of "None" are encountered when calculating weighted Robinson-Foulds or Euclidean distances, EXCEPT if the edges are root edges (i.e., edges subtending the root node).
    * Deep-coalescence counting methods now moved to a distinct module: ``dendropy.reconcile``:

        - ``dendropy.reconcile.reconciliation_discordance``
        - ``dendropy.reconcile.monophyletic_partition_discordance``

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

    * ``TaxonSetPartition`` iterator now iterates over partitions without crashing.
    * When a ``Tree`` object is independently written, its ``TaxonSet`` no longer gets re-created.
    * Corrected variable reference when inferring ``TaxonSet`` of a ``Tree`` object.
    * Correct list comprehension when composing ``Node`` and ``Edge`` sets of a ``Tree`` object.

Release 3.2.2
-------------

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

    * ``Node.level()`` now works correctly.

Release 3.2.1
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    *  Taxon objects can now be accessed from a TaxonSet directly by their label::

        >>> taxonset = TaxonSet(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        >>> assert taxonset[0] is taxonset['a'] # True

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

    * Fixed taxon-pruning clean-up resulting in all leaves being removed (!).

    * Fixed improper value returned for latest commit date when running under Windows.


Release 3.2.0
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * DendroPy is now backwards-compatible with Python 2.4.
    * Native ASCII tree plotting is available as the "``as_ascii_plot()``" method of a ``Tree`` object.
    * Some tree distance functions integrated as native methods of ``Tree``: ``symmetric_difference``, ``false_positives_and_negatives``, ``robinson_foulds_distance``, ``euclidean_distance``.
    * ``Tree()`` objects can now be cloned with a custom ``TaxonSet`` object by passing it to the constructor via the ``taxon_set`` keyword argument.
    * Interoperability with the `ETE <http://ete.cgenomics.org/>`_ library via the ``dendropy.interop.ete`` module.

Release 3.1.3
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * New character matrix type added: ``NucleotideCharacterMatrix`` (corresponding to NEXUS '``datatype=nucleotide``').
    * Symbol '``X``' added to DNA, RNA and Nucleotide alphabets.

Release 3.1.2
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * '``--unrooted``' option added to SumTrees, forcing trees to be treated as unrooted (option '``--rooted``' is also still available, forcing trees to be treated as rooted).

Release 3.1.1
-------------

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

    * SumTrees now handles '``--rooted``' option correctly; previously unrooted trees were treated as rooted, leading to incorrect split supports when structurally-equivalent trees of different rotations were used.


Release 3.1
-----------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * FASTA format reading now accepts '``fasta``' as a schema specification::

        >>> import dendropy
        >>> cytb = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.get_from_path("data.fas", "fasta")

      but requires supplemental keyword argument, '``data_type``' to specify type of data ('``dna``', '``rna``', '``protein``', etc.) when using `DataSet`::

        >>> import dendropy
        >>> cytb_ds = dendropy.DataSet.get_from_path("data.fas", "fasta", data_type="dna")

    * Implemented full-featured PHYLIP reader and enhanced PHYLIP writer, for both strict and relaxed modes (PHYLIP reader requires 'data_type' keyword argument when using `DataSet`)::

        >>> import dendropy
        >>> cytb = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.get_from_path("data.dat", "phylip")
        >>> cytb.write_to_path("data2.dat", "phylip", strict=True)
        >>> cytb_ds = dendropy.DataSet.get_from_path("data2.dat", "phylip", data_type="dna", strict=True)

    * Setup is now zipsafe by default.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

    * Fixed major bug in SumTrees when mapping support to target tree (support value did not get written to node label).
    * Fixed bug in handling trailing whitespaces in interleaved NEXUS data.
    * Fixed issue with encoding of splits when root has degree one.

Release 3.0
-----------

    * Initial release of Dendropy 3.
