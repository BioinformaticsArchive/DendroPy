Release 3.1.4
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * DendroPy is now backwards-compatible with Python 2.4.
    * Native ASCII tree plotting is available as the "``as_ascii_plot()``" method of a ``Tree`` object.
    * Interoperability with the `ETE <http://ete.cgenomics.org/>`_ library via the ``dendropy.interop.ete`` module.

Release 3.1.3
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * New character matrix type added: ``NucleotideCharacterMatrix`` (corresponding to NEXUS '``datatype=nucleotide``').
    * Symbol '``X``' added to DNA, RNA and Nucleotide alphabets.

Release 3.1.2
-------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * '``--unrooted``' option added to SumTrees, forcing trees to be treated as unrooted (option '``--rooted``' is also still available, forcing trees to be treated as rooted).

Release 3.1.1
-------------

Fixes
^^^^^

    * SumTrees now handles '``--rooted``' option correctly; previously unrooted trees were treated as rooted, leading to incorrect split supports when structurally-equivalent trees of different rotations were used.


Release 3.1
-----------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * FASTA format reading now accepts '``fasta``' as a schema specification::

        >>> import dendropy
        >>> cytb = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.get_from_path("data.fas", "fasta")

      but requires supplemental keyword argument, '``data_type``' to specify type of data ('``dna``', '``rna``', '``protein``', etc.) when using `DataSet`::

        >>> import dendropy
        >>> cytb_ds = dendropy.DataSet.get_from_path("data.fas", "fasta", data_type="dna")

    * Implemented full-featured PHYLIP reader and enhanced PHYLIP writer, for both strict and relaxed modes (PHYLIP reader requires 'data_type' keyword argument when using `DataSet`)::

        >>> import dendropy
        >>> cytb = dendropy.DnaCharacterMatrix.get_from_path("data.dat", "phylip")
        >>> cytb.write_to_path("data2.dat", "phylip", strict=True)
        >>> cytb_ds = dendropy.DataSet.get_from_path("data2.dat", "phylip", data_type="dna", strict=True)

    * Setup is now zipsafe by default.

Fixes
^^^^^

    * Fixed major bug in SumTrees when mapping support to target tree (support value did not get written to node label).
    * Fixed bug in handling trailing whitespaces in interleaved NEXUS data.
    * Fixed issue with encoding of splits when root has degree one.

Release 3.0
-----------

    * Initial release of Dendropy 3.
